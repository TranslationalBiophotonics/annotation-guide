## Welcome to the Tulane Annotation Guide

Thank you for your participation in this multi-institutional study. This guide is intented for collaborators with Tulane University on studies involving annotation of whole-slide histopathology images. This guide will serve as both a tutorial on how to perform annotations in the annopath.tulane.edu platform, as well as guidance on how those annotations should be structured.

Begin by selecting the relevant collection of images you will be annotating. In this example we select **Prostatic Adenocarcinoma (PRAD)** cases, which contain images in folders by institution. Select the institution that you will be annotating images for. In this example we will select **Radboud** for University Medical Center Radboud.

When selected, a thumbnail display of all images within that folder will display, as shown below:

Select the first image you intend to annotate, then select **Open**. In this example, we will select the first image in the list, **pds_1_HE.tif**. This will open a whole-slide image viewer, as shown below:

We are now ready to begin our first annotation!
